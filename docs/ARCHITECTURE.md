# Architecture, project structure and design system

## Reading route

Start with the module map below, then follow the part relevant to your change:

- Agent startup and process lifecycle: `src/main/index.ts` and `src/main/pty.ts`.
- Connected mailbox calls and access checks: `src/main/integrationBroker.ts`,
  `src/main/mail.ts` and `src/shared/mailboxes.ts`.
- Folder access rules: `src/shared/folderAccess.ts`.
- What the current build exposes: `src/shared/buildFeatures.ts` and
  `src/shared/agentProvider.ts`.

For agent coordination rather than file locations, read [HIVE.md](../HIVE.md).

## Architecture

Two data planes feed one renderer:

```

```

- **Terminal plane.** The main process owns a `PtyManager` that spawns each agent as a `node-pty`
  process and streams output over per-id IPC (`pty:data:<id>`). The renderer talks only through a
  typed `window.cth` bridge ([`src/preload/index.ts`](../src/preload/index.ts)), which also exposes
  sandboxed filesystem and git helpers.
- **Hive / event plane.** `hive.ts` is the on-disk multi-agent layer; `hooks.ts` runs the hook
  server that provider bridges POST lifecycle payloads to (`cth-hook` for Claude Code, `agy-hook`
  for Antigravity). `memory.ts` wraps the semantic memory CLI. The router delivers messages, drains
  provider outboxes, the GOD agent adjudicates, and idle/inbox wakeups keep workers draining mail.

                             with Remind and Close without them (never pty:kill: that archives the agent).

    workStyleConvert.ts      turns a plain work style into an agent's instructions and back, and writes the
                             hire wizard's "Suggest me" draft
    transcriptText.ts        reads a hidden Claude call's answer from its own session transcript

                             off by default, then per agent;
                             books roles like Oscar default to Read only)
    officeOpen.ts            the Office open message each agent gets after closing time

## Design system

The look is **Studio** (design system v2): a calm isometric office drawn in SVG, with Sora for
the interface and JetBrains Mono for data, in light and dark. [`branding/DESIGN.md`](../branding/DESIGN.md)
is canonical; every component derives from its tokens (`src/renderer/src/design/`). Team members
are the cast of *The Office*, each shown as a pod in their department's color.
