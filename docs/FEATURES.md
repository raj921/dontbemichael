# Don't Be Michael: features and changes

Everything the app does today, and every release that got it here (0.0.1 to 0.1.3). Part 1 is
written to be lifted onto the GitHub page and the website as it is; Part 2 is the full list, release
by release.

## Reading this history

The highlights describe the current product. The release entries record what
changed at that time, including features that a later release may hide or
replace. Read the newer entries before treating an older feature as available.

For installation steps, see [Getting started](../README.md#getting-started).
For the current feature switches, see
[`buildFeatures.ts`](../src/shared/buildFeatures.ts).

## Part 1: Feature highlights

**One line:** An AI office for your small business. Talk to Michael, your office manager, and a
team of AI employees does the work on your computer.

**Short pitch:** Pick your kind of business and your team. Every team member is an AI agent with a
job, its own folder, its own mailbox and its own memory. Michael hands out the work, keeps the team
moving, and brings you only the decisions that need you.

### 1. Michael runs the office
- You talk to one person. Michael sends each job to whoever's job it is, runs an hourly standup,
  keeps the task board right and brings you only what needs you.
- Only Michael assigns work. When one team member needs another to do something, it goes through
  Michael, so work never bounces between two agents. Teammates can still ask each other questions.
- Michael decides the team's day to day requests himself, such as a new schedule, and asks you only
  when the facts can't settle it, sources disagree, or it is sensitive.
- Your answer to a question becomes Michael's work: he routes it and closes it, and the Tasks view
  shows which cards sit with him. Blocked always means waiting on you, Waiting shows who a card
  waits on, and a card ends only as Done.
- A question stays on Ask me until you answer it or Michael withdraws it, and your answer goes only
  to Michael. When a question names a file saved in the office, open it right from the card.
- Only Michael sends you desktop notifications. Talk 1:1 with any team member when you want to.

### 2. Hire the right person in four steps
- Who, Job, Role, Finalize. Pick a character from The Office and they bring a real job: the one a
  teammate already does, the one written for your kind of business, or any job from another
  business. Or write a new one.
- No two teammates do the same work. The app checks every new job against the team by what each
  one handles; an overlap has to be tied to its own mailbox or topic before you can hire.
- The work style is in plain words you can edit, or Suggest me writes a first one for you. The app
  turns it into the agent's instructions.
- A new hire's one time first job is a card Michael hands out, not a line in their work style.
- Every hire gets its own private folder and starts working.

### 3. A mailbox for every job
- Connect as many mailboxes as your business runs on: Gmail, Google Workspace, iCloud, Yahoo, Zoho
  or any IMAP mailbox. Passwords stay encrypted on your computer.
- Give each team member the one mailbox that fits its job: the Admin watches the CEO's inbox,
  Support answers support@, Sales follows up from sales@. One team member per mailbox.
- Choose Can send or Draft only for each one. A team member can't reach a mailbox you didn't give it.
- The Executive Admin keeps the inbox at zero: every email is routed, tracked, filed or cleared and
  leaves the inbox. Archiving, marking read and marking junk never delete anything.

### 4. Jobs on a clock
- Each team member's schedules sit on its Access tab. Name the job ("Check the support
  inbox"), when, and its focus area, what to concentrate on each run; it does the job the way its
  work style says. A new hire can arrive with its jobs already set, like Inbox to zero.
- One job can run at several times: every 2 hours on weekdays between 8 and 6, plus 2 pm at weekends.
- Closing time pauses the office; opening it runs a missed job once, never a backlog.

### 5. Memory that gets better
- Each team member keeps a short list of lasting notes: your preferences and corrections, facts it
  looked up, where things live, and the steps for jobs it repeats. A background tidy up merges and
  updates them instead of letting them pile up.
- Your answers to its questions go straight into its memory, so it doesn't ask again.
- Company profile and company knowledge (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, and scans on a Mac) are
  shared with the whole team, searchable by meaning.

### 6. You stay in charge
- Every connector on your Claude account (HubSpot, Google Drive, Gmail, QuickBooks and the rest)
  shows up in Settings by itself, off. Turn one on, then give it to the team members who need it.
  Nobody else can reach it, and your own Claude Code servers stay yours.
- Spending money, deleting things and anything public come to you first, on the Needs you board.
  While anything waits it stays open; when nothing at all waits it gets out of the way and the
  office fills the window.
- Private folders: each team member opens only its own; Michael can read the team's work but not
  change it. Enforced by Claude Code's sandbox on a Mac. On Windows, the app checks Claude's file
  tools, but shell commands are not limited yet.
- House rules for every agent: say where a fact came from, say when it doesn't know, never make up
  people, customers or quotes. A looping agent is steered, then held, then stopped.

### 7. An office you can watch
- A pod for each department around Michael's glass office, each with its painted floor sign, and
  every team member with a signature prop on their desk and as their avatar. Desks light up as team members clock
  in and go dark at closing time, envelopes fly between pods as work moves, and idle teammates
  trade lines across the office by paper plane.
- Every team member has a Profile, Access, Messages, Memory and Work tab written for owners, not
  developers. Views for the task board and for who talks to whom, over any time from the last hour
  to the last month.

### 8. Built for small business owners
- Setup by kind of business: restaurant and food, retail, professional services, home services,
  SaaS and consulting, or anything else. Each comes with a suggested team.
- Runs on your computer with the Claude plan you already have. Plain words, no developer settings.
  A Windows 11 (x64) beta ships with every release.

## Part 2: Every change, release by release

### 0.1.3 (2026-10-05)
- The GitHub page offers the Windows 11 beta beside the Mac download: platform badge, download
  link, what you need and install steps, including Run anyway when Windows protects your PC.
- The docs say what is Mac only for now: reading scans and photos, and the sandbox that keeps
  shell commands inside each team member's folder. Saved passwords are described as encrypted on
  your computer.

### 0.1.2 (2026-10-05)
- The Windows 11 (x64) beta installer ships with every release, beside the Mac download.
- A Beta pill sits beside the version in the top bar, with a tip that says where Report a
  problem is; its tip opens above the Tasks board.

### 0.1.1 (2026-10-05)
- A question on Ask me never disappears unanswered: it leaves only when you answer it or Michael
  withdraws it, and Task detail says when one was withdrawn and why. Each open question has its
  own row. Michael is told each turn about cards holding questions the wrong way.
- Your answer goes only to Michael, who routes it. Closing a card, fixing a mailbox or finishing
  a card by voice withdraws its open questions.
- A question that names a file saved in the office lists it with Open, or Show in Finder (Show in
  folder on Windows). Only files in the office and team folders count.
- Closing time and office open notices no longer fly to desks; idle chit chat is paper planes.
- A Beta pill and Report a problem in Settings. Archive and Sent mail searches explain a miss.
- Windows 11 (x64) beta, on the 0.1.1 release and every release after it.

### 0.1.0 (2026-10-04)
- A new hire's one time first task is a card Michael hands out at hire, not a line in their Work
  style. A First task you type into a Work style, when hiring or in Edit, becomes a card too.
  Existing team members' old First task text is moved out once, and any standing duty it held
  is now a scheduled starter job.
- The Tasks view has a yellow Waiting column: a card someone is working on but waiting for a
  teammate's reply shows who it waits on. Only Michael moves cards into Waiting or Blocked.
- The floor has character: each team member has a signature prop as their avatar and on their
  desk, departments have painted floor signs, and the office has plants, a water cooler and
  Michael's mug. An office keeps the ring layout up to nine pods.
- Who talks to whom reads by time, from the last hour to the last month, shows teammates talking
  to each other, and connects you only to Michael. The Topics layer is gone.
- Suggest me on the hire wizard writes a first Work style, streamed into the field as it is
  written. Closing a hire who took work from teammates gives it back, and it returns with them.
- Mail tools search sent mail, the archive and labels, and never read drafts, trash or junk.
- A team member who needs a fact asks the teammate who has it before Michael. Every character
  has break room lines of their own, and the office window opens filling the screen.

### 0.0.16 (2026-10-03)
- Your Ask me answer is now Michael's open work. It reaches him as a request about the card, stays
  in front of him on every turn until he routes the follow up and closes it, and one whose request
  did not go out is sent at the next launch. The Tasks view shows those cards as With Michael, and
  as not moved after one work day of your office hours.
- Blocked now always means waiting on you. A blocked card with nothing on Needs you is shown to
  Michael every turn, and marked Nothing asked on the Tasks view, until he asks you its question
  or moves it to Doing with who it waits on.
- A card ends only as Done. Dismissing a card, or moving it to Done yourself, closes it as Done by
  your decision, marked Closed by owner, instead of deleting it, and Michael is told of every card
  you move or close.
- Every scheduled job has a focus area: what to concentrate on each time it runs. It is written on
  the job, shown with the team member's Work style, sent only with that job's run, and checked
  against the Work style when you save. Older jobs keep running and show No focus area until
  you add one on the job.
- The Executive Admin works to inbox zero in every business type: every email is routed, tracked,
  filed or cleared and leaves the inbox, and nothing is deleted. Her mail tools can now archive
  under a label, mark read and mark junk. A new hire comes with an Inbox to zero job every 2 hours
  during office hours, and an office that hired her before is offered the new job description on
  Needs you.
- At closing time, someone who has gone home is gone from the floor: their desk goes dark, their
  name leaves the chip, and nothing opens them until you cancel. Michael stays at his desk until
  the office is closed.
- Job descriptions name nobody: a team member's role line and Work style say what the job is, and
  teammates are named by role, so renaming anyone never leaves a stale name. Text from older hires
  that still names someone is updated when that person is renamed.
- Michael has a Work style like everyone else, with a default for every office, and the hourly
  standup's focus is to close your open requests first, then check the floor.
- The Needs you column stays open while anything waits on you and gets out of the way when nothing
  does. Edit agent is one column over the profile, with the engine folded away. Profiles list only
  the connections a team member really has. Every agent reports what its tools cannot do instead
  of working around it. Michael's idle notification is a light reminder at most every few hours.
- Only Michael sets a card to Blocked; Task detail and voice offer To do, Doing and Done. Nothing
  in the app deletes a card any more.
- An archive label can never name trash, junk or another system folder, or a folder inside one,
  and every mail move an agent makes is written to the office log. The launch catch-up relays
  only answers you gave in the app, word for word; cards answered before this update show to
  Michael as Blocked with nothing asked.
- Closing time no longer hangs on Michael, a message an agent is still writing is never thrown
  away, and a message typed into a busy terminal is confirmed as sent.
- The menus are trimmed: no File menu on the Mac, no Reload or developer tools in an installed
  app, and the second office window (New Floor) is gone.

### 0.0.15 (2026-10-02)
- Claude connectors. Settings > Connections lists every connector on your Claude account, read
  from Claude when the app starts, when you open Connections and when you press Refresh. Each one
  is off until you turn it on, and a team member uses it only once its Access tab gives it.
  Connectors that need sign in link to claude.ai; ones that left your account show Removed.
- Until now every team member could reach every connector except QuickBooks and Gmail. After the
  update the others are off, and one Ask me card names them. QuickBooks keeps your switch and each
  team member's choice; Gmail and Google Calendar, if you had them on, stay on for everyone.
- Team members no longer load your own Claude Code servers or plugin servers. A team member whose
  connectors change restarts when it is idle, in the same conversation, or right away with
  Restart now on its Access tab.
- Settings is simpler: Agents and Autonomy are one Agents tab, About and Updates are one card
  whose What's new opens the notes for the version you are on, and Mailboxes fold into one line
  that opens by itself when one needs you. Default MCP servers, Explain things simply, Arabic
  text in terminals and Language are hidden, and updates are always checked.
- Schedule rows read in three quiet lines: the job and its next run, when it runs, and how the
  last run went.

### 0.0.14 (2026-10-01)
- A new look, Studio. The pixel floor is gone: the office is a calm isometric studio with a pod
  and a chip for each team, lights that come up as the office opens, and handoffs, mail and
  Michael's numbers drawn from real events. Every screen, dialog, setup step and Settings field
  uses the same fonts, colors and inputs, in light and dark.
- Idle team members say lines from The Office, and two of them trade a line by paper plane or
  envelope. A quiet pod's card rolls down from under its chip, and selecting someone dims the rest.
- Needs you is the one count. Ask me cards have plain titles, the answer box and Talk to Michael
  grow as you type, and Talk to Michael takes pasted screenshots and files. Task detail shows the
  card's notes.
- Closing time runs on the floor with Cancel and Force quit, starts from the clock menu too, and
  leaves open dialogs as they were. A team member's tabs are Profile, Access, Messages, Memory
  and Work.

### 0.0.13 (2026-09-30)
- Claude Code updates itself, but team members already running keep the old version until they
  restart. The app notices within ten minutes and shows a "team upgrade ready" chip in the title
  bar and a note in the corner.
- One click closes the office the safe way (every agent saves and confirms), then the app reopens
  on the new version; the closing time dialog says "reopening". Nothing restarts on its own, and
  "later" hides the note until a newer version arrives.

### 0.0.12 (2026-09-30)
- Saved passwords and keys (mailboxes, engines, integrations) can't be lost to a crash mid-save:
  the secrets file is swapped in whole, so a crash, power cut or full disk leaves the old file or
  the new one, never a torn one.
- A secrets file that is there but can't be read is never saved over; saving a new secret fails
  with a message instead of erasing the others. The file is always owner-only.

### 0.0.11 (2026-09-30)
- QuickBooks through your Claude account; the app does not connect to Intuit itself. One switch
  in Settings > Connections > QuickBooks, off by default. On, it shows whether your Claude account
  has QuickBooks connected, or the steps to connect it.
- Each Capabilities tab: Can use QuickBooks, then Read only or Can make changes. Oscar starts on
  and Read only; everyone else starts off. A change applies on the next step, with no restart.
- Read only is a fixed list of reads; anything else, loan shopping and peer loan offers included,
  is refused. Known limit: a separate Claude started from a team member's terminal is outside
  the check; a fix is planned.

### 0.0.10 (2026-09-29)
- Closing time shows who is still working: every team member and Michael, confirmed, still
  working, waiting at a prompt or nothing to do, with what each is doing and for how long.
- Remind sends one agent the closing steps again; Close without them stops waiting for one team
  member. Nothing is stopped, and a row goes when that agent's terminal ends.

### 0.0.9 (2026-09-28)
- No app changes. The old project's website files, promo media and 42 of its blog posts left the
  repo; the release drops, message queue and company knowledge docs match the app again.

### 0.0.8 (2026-09-27)
- New hire wizard: Who, Job, Role, Finalize. Jobs come from a teammate, your business pack, any
  other business, or a new one; lists open on the character's own kind of job.
- Distinct job check against every teammate (by what they handle, never the title); an overlap
  must be bound to its own mailbox or topic, and the teammate's line hands that work over.
- Work style in plain words, turned into instructions when you hire or save (Edit Agent too).
- Own folder per hire (Admin_Erin when Admin is taken); model picked from a list that starts on
  your default; developer options hidden; explanations behind info icons.
- Only Michael assigns work; the asker is told; a runaway message tells Michael.
- Michael decides schedule requests and escalates only what he can't settle, or anything left
  undecided for 12 hours. Each request says why; two about the same job become one.
- One agent per mailbox, with a confirm before moving one.
- Several "when" lines per schedule; a day an "every" line runs on belongs to it alone; 4h added.
- Erin joins the cast; character tiles grouped by job; Sadiq and Darryl redrawn; break room lines
  for every character; "clocking in…" and "nothing to do" in the office; the memory graph shows
  each agent's character.
- Fixed: one agent's memory tidy could read another agent's answer; the hire dialog closing by
  accident.

### 0.0.7 (2026-09-26)
- A mailbox for each agent (Gmail, Google Workspace, iCloud, Yahoo, Zoho, IMAP), tested and kept
  in the keychain; Can send or Draft only.
- Capabilities tab on every agent: email and schedules in one place.
- The office opens again after closing time; a missed job runs once, not once per missed hour.
- Michael's Office schedule lists every job that is on. Sections start closed. Settings simpler.
- The Email and Calendar switch now really blocks those tools.

### 0.0.6 (2026-09-26)
- Setup fills in your legal name and marks every required field.
- Reset and Restart fixes.

### 0.0.5 (2026-09-25)
- Every agent has its own schedules; agents ask for changes instead of making them.
- Profile tab first on every agent: the job, what it does, what it asks first, its folder and
  instructions. Memory tab that reads like notes.
- You talk to team members through Michael, or 1:1. Only Michael notifies you.
- Messages tab as a day by day history.

### 0.0.4 (2026-09-25)
- Names change only in Edit Agent and reach the whole team; duplicates refused.
- The new brand: Don't Be Michael lockup and the Struck M icon.

### 0.0.3 (2026-09-25)
- Private folders, enforced by the sandbox and the app. Michael works in the business folder.
- Company profile and company knowledge (searchable by meaning with MemPalace).
- Memory that improves: short notes, a background tidy up, procedures for repeated jobs.
- A fresh start for idle team members after a written handoff; the old conversation can come back.
- Schedules name the job, not a prompt. Ask me answers go back to whoever asked and are remembered.
- House rules for every agent. New instructions for Michael and the team from each business pack.
- Plainer app messages; notifications name the person; developer surfaces removed.

### 0.0.2 (2026-09-24)
- The app keeps its settings in its own folder and carries its own name and copyright.

### 0.0.1 (2026-09-24)
- First release: set up by kind of business with Office Packs, a folder for every team member,
  real documents in Memory & Knowledge, Office, Tasks and Graph views, Michael asking when no one
  fits, and a floor built for owners in English, Chinese and Arabic.
